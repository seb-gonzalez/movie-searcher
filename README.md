# Movie search

Application that retrieves all movies that have a title contain the search term.


## Getting Started

For a successful set up in your local machine you just have to download this
repository into your machine, then you should import this project as an 'Existing Maven Project'.

```
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/sebachili/movie-searcher.git
git pull -u origin master
```


## Running the App

The command line application must:
* Take a single argument specifying the search term, and error out if one is not provided
* Using the Open Movie Database API as a starting point, find all movies that have a title containing the given search term, and also have a Poster available. ThereÂ´s no need to actually retrieve the high resolution poster image using the sort the results by Year ascending.
* Ouput one line for each result, in the following format: 
  ```{title} [{year}] - {poster_url}```
* After the results, on a separate line, output the number of results in the format: 
  ```=> {count} result(s) found``` 

```
search term:
